A 180-Day AI Legal Ops Roadmap for an AI-First Fund
Part 3 of 3. Part 1 covered the philosophy. Part 2 covered the NDA build. This part is about the rollout.
A few weeks after we turned on NDA traffic lights, I opened our dashboard.
On one hand, it was great: NDA turnaround was down, self-service was up, and Sales wasn't Slacking me every hour. On the other hand, my brain immediately went to: "Okay, what about everything else?"
NDAs were solved, but DPAs were piling up. Vendor intake required three different questionnaires. E-billing lived in a spreadsheet only two people understood. And I could hear the inevitable question from a board member: "This NDA thing is clever, but how exactly are you using AI in legal?"
It reminded me of Djokovic. He doesn't just tweak his serve; he optimizes the entire system—match data, diet, sleep, recovery. We had fixed one stroke (NDAs), but the rest of the "training plan" needed structure.
So we gave ourselves 180 days to answer two questions:
Can we extd NDAs without breaking trust?
Can we do it in a way that makes our lawyers and board comfortable?
Here is the roadmap we followed.
Days 0–30: The Foundation
Focus: Sandbox + NDA Dev + Communications Monitor Feeling: Cautious optimism.
We started with security. We provisioned the sandbox: secure workspace, document retrieval (no model training), single sign-on, role-based access, least-privilege connectors, development → staging → production, and matter-scoped indexes so information barriers held.
Set information barriers by business unit, matter, and client.
Turned off provider-side training.
Connected CLM, ticketing, and storage as read-only.
The Win: We deployed the Communications Monitor to watch a single email and Slack channel.
The Learning: Early on, duplicate tickets caused confusion. We added de-duplication by reference ID, and "where is this?" pings dropped 36%.
Days 31–60: Production & Risk Scoring
Focus: NDAs to Prod, DPA Scorer, Clause Librarian Feeling: Relief. The Red/Yellow/Greenly looked like a chart, not a Christmas tree.
With NDAs behaving, we shipped a DPA Risk Scorer. It extracts data categories and transfer mechanisms, escalating only when thresholds trip (e.g., minors' data). We also added a Clause Librarian that acts like a senior associate, retrieving standard language when a clause raises questions.
Days 61–90: Follow the Money
Focus: E-billing audit, Public Process Summaries Feeling: Skepticism melting into trust.
We stood up E-billing review to parse LEDES files and PDF invoices. It flagged block billing, out-of-scope staffing, and rate caps.
The Finding: The system flagged $17,400 of block-billed admin time across three matters. We shared this with counsel, adjusted the bills, and clarified expectations. Trust went up, not down.
Days 91–120: The Cross-Functional Layer
Focus: Vendor Intake Router, DSAR Triage Feeling: Momentum.
We unified three separate questionnaires (Legal, Security, IT) into one Vendor Intake Router. We also added DSAR triage for data-heavy por companies, cutting response prep time significantly.
The Stat: Vendor onboarding time dropped from a median of 14 days to 6.
Days 121–150: Hardening Governance
Focus: DPIAs, RoPA, Pen Tests, Drills Feeling: Respect for the boring things.
The workflows worked; now we had to prove they were safe. We ran DPIAs, updated our RoPA, and conducted a friendly pen test of the sandbox. We held incident tabletops (what if a doc is misrouted?) and practiced kill-switch drills.
Days 151–180: Scale and Prune
Focus: Product Counsel Review, Entity Manager, Pruning Feeling: Pride—and honesty.
We added workflows for product counsel and entity management. Crucially, we retired experiments that didn't move a metric (RIP, board-packet summarizer). We shipped an operating manual including a control matrix mapped to NIST AI RMF and ISO 42001.
Governance that builds trust
We anchored everything to one principle: Attorneys remain responsible for legal advice. Automated steps assist; they do not decide.
To support that, the ent is control-first:
Identity: Role-based access, just-in-time elevation.
Secrets: Never hard-coded in prompts.
Logging: Every run is tagged with a reference ID tying inputs to approvals.
Vendor Gov: SOC 2 baseline, HIPAA where relevant, strictly documented sub-processors.
The Scoreboard (Directional, but real)
Within ten weeks across a software-heavy portfolio:
NDA median time: Dropped from 2 days to 2 hours.
Self-service: 76% of requests went Green.
DPA backlog: Shrank 40%.
E-billing: Variance fell 12% via pre-payment audits.
NPS: Requester satisfaction rose +2.1 points.
On a tennis court, most points are forgettable. Only a few decide the match.
A few decide the match.
When you watch Nadal or Djokovic, you see that it isn't just talent—it's the systems around their judgment that let them show up differently on the points that count.
Legal is the same. Automated steps don't replace judgment; they buy it time. Clear the unforced errors, and you're fresh for the break points that decide your deal company's risk profile.
Standard note: This is an operational playbook, not legal advice.
